My name is Jason, I'm a passionate self-taught full-stack web developer. With experience that spans all types of galaxies, and fluent in all types of languages. Some of my favorites are Javascript, CSS,  and TypeScript just to name a few. 

My side job is a wannabe astronaut with a keen eye for exploring every modern framework known to man. I'm usually in space ðŸ”­ but if you can't find me there look at my social media's.
